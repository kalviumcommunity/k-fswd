# Lab Exercise: Get from API and Render in React 🚀

## 🎯 Objectives

To master the process of fetching data from an API in React and dynamically rendering that data in a component.

## 🧩 Prerequisites

A solid grasp of React fundamentals and familiarity with making API requests using JavaScript.

## 📝 Steps

1. **Create a Component for Data Fetching**: Develop a new React component, let's name it `DataDisplay`. Decide if it will be a functional component using hooks or a class-based component.

2. **Select an API for Data Retrieval**: Please navigate to the settings icon located in the navigation sidebar. Within the settings, you will find a URL indicating where the server is currently running. The `URL` should end with `.codedamn.app`.

4. **Implement API Data Fetching**: In your `DataDisplay` component, write a function to fetch data from the selected API. Use the `useEffect` hook for functional components.

5. **Manage Component State**: Set up state in your component to store the API data. Also, include a state for managing the loading status during the API call.

6. **Render the Data**: Once the data is fetched, render it in your component.

## 🏁 Outcome

Completion of this lab exercise will enhance your skills in integrating API data with React components, demonstrating the ability to create dynamic, data-driven user interfaces in a full-stack development environment. 🌟
