# Lab Exercise: Automating Deployment with `deploy.js`

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and simulate the deployment process of services like Netlify/Cloudflare.
- Gain practical experience in writing scripts for automating deployment tasks.

## 🔐 Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js file system (`fs`) module.

## 📝 Steps
1. 📚 Start by setting up your development environment, ensuring Node.js is installed.
2. 📁 Create a `dev` folder and populate it with some dummy files to mimic your development environment.
3. 🖊️ Write a `deploy.js` script using Node.js. This script should:
   - Read all files from the `dev` folder.
   - Write the read content to a new or existing `build` folder.
4. 🏃‍♂️ Run your `deploy.js` script using the command line to ensure it works as expected.
5. 🐛 Debug and refine your script as necessary, ensuring it successfully transfers all content from `dev` to `build`.

## 🎁 Outcome
- By the end of this task, you will have a working `deploy.js` script, simulating the deployment process of Netlify/Cloudflare, and automating part of your full stack development workflow.
