# Lab Exercise: Node.js Express Server Lab - II

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
In this lab exercise, you'll learn how to set up an Express.js server and handle a simple GET request. The goal is to create a route "/ping" and have it respond with "pong" in a JSON format.

## ðŸ“š Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Node.js, Express.js, and JavaScript is required for this exercise.

## ðŸš€ Steps

1. Open the `server.js` file in your code editor.
2. Define a route handler for the `/ping` endpoint that responds with a JSON object `{ "message": "pong" }`.
3. Start the server on a port (e.g., 3000).
4. Test your server by starting it with `node server.js` and then sending a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/ping` using a tool like Postman or your browser. You should see a JSON response with the message "pong".

## ðŸŽ‰ Outcome
By the end of this exercise, you'll have a basic Express.js server that responds to a "/ping" GET request with a JSON message "pong". This foundational knowledge will be crucial for building more complex applications in the future. Happy coding! ðŸ˜„
