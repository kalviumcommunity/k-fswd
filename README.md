# Lab Exercise: Create a Component Which Takes User Input 📝

## Objectives 🎯
In this task, we aim to build a React component that captures and handles user input. This will enhance your understanding of state management and event handling in React.

## Prerequisites 🧐
A basic understanding of JavaScript and React is required for this task.

## Steps 🚀

1. **Initialize State**: Inside your 'UserInput' component, initialize a state variable to store the user's input.

2. **Create an Input Field**: Add an HTML input field in the component's render method.

3. **Handle Input Change**: Write a method that updates the state with the user's input every time it changes. Attach this method to the input field's `onChange` event.

4. **Display User Input**: Optionally, display the user's input somewhere in your component to verify it's being captured correctly.

## Outcome 🏁
By the end of this task, you will have a functional React component that can take, handle, and display user input. This is a crucial skill in building interactive web applications.
