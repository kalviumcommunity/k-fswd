# Lab Exercise: Add react-router-dom to the React App and Create a /home Page with a Welcome Note 🚀

## Objectives 🎯

In this module, we will incorporate `react-router-dom` into our React application to enable routing. We'll also create a `/home` page that displays a warm welcome note to the user.

## Prerequisites 📚

You should have a basic understanding of React and Node.js. Familiarity with npm or yarn is also required.

## Steps 🚶‍♂️

1. **Install react-router-dom** 📦: Run `npm install react-router-dom` or `yarn add react-router-dom` in your project directory.

2. **Import BrowserRouter** 🌐: In your main `App.js` file, import `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom`.

3. **Wrap the App Component** 🎁: Wrap your main `<App />` component with `<BrowserRouter>` in your `index.js` file.

4. **Import Route and Switch** 🔄: Back in your `App.js` file, import the `Route` and `Switch` components from `react-router-dom`.

5. **Create the Home Component** 🏠: Create a new component named `Home` that returns a div with a welcome note.

6. **Set up the Route** 🛣️: Use the `Route` component inside `Routes` to set up the `/home` route. Assign the `Home` component to this route.


## Outcome 🎉

By the end of this module, you will have successfully added `react-router-dom` to your React app and created a `/home` page that displays a welcome note. Your app now has the foundational setup for routing between different pages.
