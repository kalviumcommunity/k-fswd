# Lab Exercise: Decrypting SHA256 Hash with Salt

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand SHA256 hashing with the addition of a salt.
- Develop skills in hash decryption with known salt values.

## 🔍 Prerequisites

- Familiarity with SHA256 and basic cryptographic concepts.

## 🚀 Steps

1. **Deep Dive into Salting**: Learn how 'salting' enhances hash security.

2. **SHA256 Hash Analysis**: Examine the given SHA256 hash of a 3-digit number concatenated with 'happy'.

3. **Strategic Guessing**: Apply reasoning and cryptographic understanding to deduce the original 3-digit number.

4. **Enter Your Solution**: Input your 3-digit number guess considering 'happy' as the salt.

5. **Verification Process**: Click 'Check' to see if your solution correctly decrypts the hash.

6. **Iterate and Reflect**: If the first attempt is not successful, reassess your strategy and try again.

## 🏁 Outcome

- Proficiency in cracking SHA256 hashes with known salt values, using analytical and cryptographic skills.
