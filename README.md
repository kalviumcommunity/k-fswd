# Lab Exercise: Fetch from API and Show Loading State🔄

## 🎯 Objectives

To learn how to fetch data from an API in React and effectively manage UI states, including displaying a loading indicator while data is being fetched.

## 🧩 Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of React, including state management, and familiarity with JavaScript for making API requests.

## 📝 Steps 

1. **Create a Data-Fetching Component**: Develop a React component named `DataLoader`. You can choose either a functional component with hooks or a class-based approach.

2. **Select a API**: Please navigate to the settings icon located in the navigation sidebar. Within the settings, you will find a `URL` indicating where the server is currently running. The `URL` should end with `.codedamn.app`.

3. **Implement Data Fetching Logic**: In your `DataLoader` component, write the logic to fetch data from the API. Use the `useEffect` hook for functional components.

4. **Manage Loading State**: Introduce state management in your component to handle the loading status. Display a loading message or spinner when the data is being fetched.

5. **Render Fetched Data**: After the data is fetched, render it in your component, transitioning from the loading state to displaying the data.

6. **Error Handling**: Include error handling logic to manage and display any fetch errors gracefully.

7. **Test the Component**: Ensure that your component correctly displays the loading state during data fetch and renders the data once it's fetched.

## 🏁 Outcome

By the end of this exercise, you will have a React component capable of fetching data from an API, managing loading states, and displaying fetched data, enhancing your full-stack development skills. 🌟
