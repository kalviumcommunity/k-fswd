# Lab Exercise: Get from API and Render in React 🚀

## Objectives 🎯
To master the process of fetching data from an API in React and dynamically rendering that data in a component.

## Prerequisites 🧩
A solid grasp of React fundamentals and familiarity with making API requests using JavaScript.

## Steps 📝

1. **Initialize React Project**: Begin by creating a new React project using Create React App. This will be the foundation for your lab exercise.

2. **Create a Component for Data Fetching**: Develop a new React component, let's name it `DataDisplay`. Decide if it will be a functional component using hooks or a class-based component.

3. **Select an API for Data Retrieval**: Pick a straightforward API for this exercise. This could be a free API like JSONPlaceholder or any other that provides test data without requiring authentication.

4. **Implement API Data Fetching**: In your `DataDisplay` component, write a function to fetch data from the selected API. Use the `useEffect` hook for functional components.

5. **Manage Component State**: Set up state in your component to store the API data. Also, include a state for managing the loading status during the API call.

6. **Render the Data**: Once the data is fetched, render it in your component.

## Outcome 🏁
Completion of this lab exercise will enhance your skills in integrating API data with React components, demonstrating the ability to create dynamic, data-driven user interfaces in a full-stack development environment. 🌟
