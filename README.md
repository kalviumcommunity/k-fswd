# Lab Exercise: Update the Browser Tab Icon and Heading

## Objectives 🎯

Learn how to customize the browser tab icon (favicon) and heading to provide a unique identity to your web application. Enhance user experience by making your website easily identifiable.

## Prerequisites 📚

Basic understanding of HTML and how to navigate the project's file structure.

## Steps 🚀

1. **Create or Choose an Icon**: The first step is to have a `.ico` or `.png` image that you want to use as your website's icon. The recommended size for a favicon is 16x16 or 32x32 pixels. You can create your own using image editing software or use an online favicon generator.

2. **Place the Icon in Your Project**: After you've created or chosen your favicon, place it in the root directory of your project (where your index.html file is located).

3. **Link the Icon in Your HTML**: In the `<head>` section of your HTML file, add a link to your favicon. The code will look something like this: `<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">` or `<link rel="icon" href="favicon.png" type="image/png">`.

4. **Update the Title**: Still in the `<head>` section of your HTML file, update the title of your webpage using the `<title>` tag. The code will look something like this: `<title>Your Website Title</title>`.

## Outcome 🏁

By the end of this task, you'll be able to personalize your website's browser tab with a unique icon and title, enhancing brand recognition and user experience.
