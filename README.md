# Node.js Express Server Lab - II

Welcome to this lab exercise where you'll get hands-on experience in building a basic Express server. This exercise is part of our Full Stack Development course, and it's designed to help you understand the basics of creating an HTTP server using Node.js and Express, a popular web application framework for Node.js.

## Objective

In this lab exercise, you're going to create a basic Express server with a `/ping` endpoint. When a client sends a GET request to this endpoint, the server should respond with "pong" in JSON format.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this exercise, you should have:

- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Familiarity with Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Basic understanding of HTTP protocol and RESTful APIs

## Instructions

Follow these steps to complete the lab:

1. Open the `server.js` file in your code editor.
2. Define a route handler for the `/ping` endpoint that responds with a JSON object `{ "message": "pong" }`.
3. Start the server on a port (e.g., 3000).
4. Test your server by starting it with `node server.js` and then sending a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/ping` using a tool like Postman or your browser. You should see a JSON response with the message "pong".

## Outcome

By the end of this lab exercise, you will have:

- Created a basic Express server.
- Defined a route that responds to HTTP GET requests.
- Tested your server using a client.

This lab exercise is an important step towards understanding server-side development with Node.js and Express. Keep up the excellent work, and happy coding! ðŸš€
