# Lab Exercies: How to Create a JWT with Different Algos

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Learn to generate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) using various cryptographic algorithms.

- Understand the application of different algorithms based on security requirements.

## ðŸ”‘ Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Node.js and cryptography.

## ðŸš€ Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Use `npm` to install `jsonwebtoken` and any specific crypto libraries needed.

2. **Choose an Algorithm**: Understand the difference between symmetric (HS256) and asymmetric (RS256, ES256) algorithms.

3. **Generate Keys**: For asymmetric algorithms, generate a public/private key pair.

4. **Create a Token**: Code a simple script to create a JWT using the selected algorithm.

5. **Verify the Token**: Implement token verification to understand the integrity and authenticity checks.

6. **Explore JWT Payload**: Customize the payload with standard and custom claims to suit your application's needs.

7. **Error Handling**: Learn to gracefully handle errors, such as token expiration or tampering.

8. **Security Best Practices**: Brief overview of securing JWT tokens and avoiding common vulnerabilities.

## ðŸŽ‰ Outcome

- Ability to generate and verify JWTs with chosen algorithms, enhancing application security.
