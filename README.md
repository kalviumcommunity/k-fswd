# Lab Exercise: Database Connection Status on Homepage

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how to establish a database connection and handle its status.
- Learn how to display the connection status on the homepage.

## 📚 Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

## 🚀 Steps

1. **Set up your project:** Initialize a new Node.js project and install Express.js and MongoDB driver using npm.

2. **Create a database connection:** Use the MongoDB driver to establish a connection to your database. Make sure to handle both the success and error cases.

3. **Implement connection status logic:** Create a function that returns the current status of the database connection.

4. **Create your homepage route:** Use Express.js to set up a route for your homepage (`/`).

5. **Display the connection status:** In your homepage route, call the function you created in step 3 and send the returned connection status as the response.

6. **Test your implementation:** Start your server and visit your homepage in a web browser. You should see the current database connection status displayed.

## 🏁 Outcome
- At the end of this task, you'll have a homepage that dynamically displays the current status of your database connection.

Happy Coding! 🎉
