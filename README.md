# Lab Exercise: Create a Function to Transform JSON Arrays

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Understand and implement JSON array transformation.
2. Develop a function that takes two JSON arrays, modifies them, and returns the transformed arrays.

## 📚 Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of JavaScript and JSON data manipulation.

## 🚀 Steps

1. Open the index.js file in your editor.
2. Read the comments in the file to understand the task.
3. Complete the function to transform the JSON arrays.
4. Run the code to see the output.

## 🏁 Outcome

By the end of this task, you will have a function that can take two JSON arrays, transform them, and return the transformed arrays. This will deepen your understanding of JSON data manipulation and JavaScript functions. 🎉👨‍💻

Remember: Practice makes perfect! The more you work with JSON and JavaScript functions, the more comfortable you'll become. Happy coding! 💻🚀
