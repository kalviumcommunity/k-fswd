# Lab Exercise: Create a Component Which Takes User Input and Performs a POST Request to an API 📝🌐

## Objectives 🎯
In this task, we will create a React component that takes user input and makes a POST request to an API. This will help you understand how to interact with APIs using React.

## Prerequisites 🧐
You should have a basic understanding of JavaScript, React, and familiarity with fetch API or axios for making HTTP requests.

## Steps 🚀

0. **Find an API**: Please navigate to the settings icon located in the navigation sidebar. Within the settings, you will find a `URL` indicating where the server is currently running. The `URL` should end with `.codedamn.app`.

1. **Create a Submit Method**: Write a method that makes a POST request to the API with the user's input when a submit button is clicked.

2. **Handle API Response**: Update the state with the API response and handle any errors that may occur during the request.

3. **Display User Input and API Response**: Display the user's input and the API response on your component to verify everything is working correctly.

## Outcome 🏁
By the end of this task, you will have a functional React component that takes user input, makes a POST request to an API, and handles the response. This is a vital skill in creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
