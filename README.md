# Write Mongoose Schema for the Given JSON Object

## 🎯 Objectives

This exercise is designed to help you understand how to convert a JSON object into a Mongoose schema. You'll be able to map JSON objects to a MongoDB document model effectively.

## 📚 Prerequisites

You should have a basic understanding of JavaScript, JSON, and MongoDB.

## 🚀 Steps

1. **Understand the JSON Object:** Take a close look at the given JSON object and understand its structure and data types.
    > 💡 Tip: You can uncomment the `console.log` statement in the `index.js` file to print the JSON object in the terminal.

2. **Create a Schema:** Use the `mongoose.Schema` function to create a new schema. The keys of the schema should correspond to the keys in the JSON object.

3. **Define Data Types:** For each key, define the corresponding data type as per the JSON object. Mongoose provides a range of data types like `String`, `Number`, `Date`, `Buffer`, `Boolean`, `Mixed`, `ObjectId`, `Array`, and `Decimal128`.

4. **Run the Code:** Run the code using the `node index.js` command and check the output in the terminal. If you get any errors, fix them and run the code again.

## 🏁 Outcome

By the end of this exercise, you will have a Mongoose schema that accurately represents the given JSON object, ready to be used in your MongoDB database operations. 🎉

Remember, practice makes perfect! Keep experimenting with different JSON objects to strengthen your understanding of Mongoose schemas. 🚀
