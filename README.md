# Lab Exercise: Create a Component Which Takes User Input 📝

## Objectives 🎯
In this task, we aim to build a React component that captures and handles user input. This will enhance your understanding of state management and event handling in React.

## Prerequisites 🧐
A basic understanding of JavaScript and React is required for this task.

## Steps 🚀
1. **Set up your React environment**: Start by setting up your React development environment. You can use vite command to create a new React project.

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest
    ```

2. **Create a new Component**: Create a new React component named 'UserInput' in your project.

   ```javascript
   function UserInput(){
      // component code here
   }

4. **Initialize State**: Inside your 'UserInput' component, initialize a state variable to store the user's input.

5. **Create an Input Field**: Add an HTML input field in the component's render method.

6. **Handle Input Change**: Write a method that updates the state with the user's input every time it changes. Attach this method to the input field's `onChange` event.

7. **Display User Input**: Optionally, display the user's input somewhere in your component to verify it's being captured correctly.

## Outcome 🏁
By the end of this task, you will have a functional React component that can take, handle, and display user input. This is a crucial skill in building interactive web applications.
