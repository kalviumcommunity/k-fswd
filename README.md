# Lab Exercise: Node.js Express Server Lab

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
The primary goal of this lab exercise is to understand how to create a basic Express server. You will also learn to set up a simple route ("/ping") and respond with a text ("pong").

## ðŸ“š Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Node.js and Express.js is required to carry out this exercise.

## ðŸš€ Steps

1. Edit `server.js` and define a `/ping` route.
2. Start the server (e.g., `node server.js`) and test on `http://localhost:3000/ping`.

## ðŸŽ‰ Outcome
By the end of this exercise, you will have a basic Express server that responds to GET requests on the "/ping" path with the text "pong". This is a fundamental step in understanding how to build web applications using Node.js and Express.js. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ’»
