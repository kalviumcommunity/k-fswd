# Lab Exercise: Building and Deploying Applications

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand the importance of build scripts in package.json for full stack development.
- Learn how to write a build script and use it to build your application.

## ðŸ“š Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js.

## ðŸš€ Steps

1. Open your project's package.json file.

2. Locate the "scripts" section and add a new key-value pair for the build script.

3. Define the build script command, specifying the necessary build steps (e.g., transpiling, bundling, minification).

4. Save the package.json file.

5. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

6. Run the build script using the npm run command followed by the script name.

7. Monitor the terminal for any errors or warnings during the build process.

8. Verify that the build process has generated the required output files (e.g., bundled JavaScript, optimized CSS).

9. Test the built application locally to ensure it functions as expected.


## ðŸŽ‰ Outcome

By the end of this course, you will be able to write a build script in package.json and successfully build your full stack application, ready for deployment. ðŸš€
