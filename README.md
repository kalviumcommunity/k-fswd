# Lab Exercise: Fetch and Display Data from an External API in Your React App

## 🎯 Objectives
This course will guide you on how to fetch data from an external API and display it in your React application, enhancing your full-stack development skills. You will also learn how to handle and display server responses effectively.

## 👨‍💻 Prerequisites
A basic understanding of JavaScript, React, and RESTful APIs is required.

## 🚀 Steps
1. **Setting up the React application**: Start by setting up a new React app using `create-react-app` or any other preferred method.

5. **Displaying the Data**: Use React components to display the fetched data on your web page. This can involve creating a dynamic list, table, or any other suitable format.

6. **Styling your App**: Use CSS or a library like `styled-components` to style your application and make the displayed data visually appealing.

## 🏁 Outcome
By the end of this course, you'll have a fully functional React application that fetches and displays data from an external API, demonstrating your proficiency in handling server responses and updating UI dynamically. 🎉
