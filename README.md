# Lab Exercise: Install the TEST_PACKAGE as dev dependency

## 🎯 Objectives

The main goal of this lab exercise is to familiarize yourself with the process of installing development dependencies, specifically the TEST_PACKAGE. You'll learn how to install packages that are only needed during the development phase and not in the production environment.

## 📚 Prerequisites

You should have a basic understanding of Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

## 🚀 Steps

1. Install the `nodemon` package.
2. Update the `start` script to use nodemon.

## 🏁 Outcome

By the end of this lab exercise, you'll have successfully installed TEST_PACKAGE as a dev dependency in your project. You'll understand the difference between dependencies and devDependencies, and how to manage them in your Node.js projects. This is a vital skill in full-stack development! 🌟
