# Lab Exercise: Data Validation with JOI Based on Roles

## 🎯 Objectives

This exercise will guide you through using JOI to validate data in a Node.js application based on different user roles.

## 🔑 Prerequisites

Familiarity with Node.js and basic understanding of user roles in web applications.

## 🚀 Steps

1. Install JOI in your project by running `npm install joi` in the terminal.

2. Import JOI into your `validation.js` file.

3. Define schema for different roles (e.g., admin, user) in JOI within `validation.js`.

4. Create a middleware in `middleware.js` to validate incoming data against the defined schema.

5. Integrate the validation middleware into your routes (e.g., `routes.js`) for role-specific endpoints.

6. Test the validation by sending requests with different role data using  [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/).

7. Handle validation errors gracefully, returning meaningful error messages to the client.

## 🎁 Outcome

Successfully implement role-based data validation in your Node.js application using JOI. 🌟🛡️
