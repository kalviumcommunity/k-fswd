# Lab Exercise: Fetch from API and Show Loading State🔄

## Objectives 🎯
To learn how to fetch data from an API in React and effectively manage UI states, including displaying a loading indicator while data is being fetched.

## Prerequisites 🧩
Basic knowledge of React, including state management, and familiarity with JavaScript for making API requests.

## Steps 📝


1. **Create a Data-Fetching Component**: Develop a React component named `DataLoader`. You can choose either a functional component with hooks or a class-based approach.

2. **Select a Suitable API**: Choose a simple API for this exercise. This could be any free, public API like JSONPlaceholder.

3. **Implement Data Fetching Logic**: In your `DataLoader` component, write the logic to fetch data from the API. Use the `useEffect` hook for functional components.

4. **Manage Loading State**: Introduce state management in your component to handle the loading status. Display a loading message or spinner when the data is being fetched.

5. **Render Fetched Data**: After the data is fetched, render it in your component, transitioning from the loading state to displaying the data.

6. **Error Handling**: Include error handling logic to manage and display any fetch errors gracefully.

7. **Test the Component**: Ensure that your component correctly displays the loading state during data fetch and renders the data once it's fetched.

## Outcome 🏁
By the end of this exercise, you will have a React component capable of fetching data from an API, managing loading states, and displaying fetched data, enhancing your full-stack development skills. 🌟
