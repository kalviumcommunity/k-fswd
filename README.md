# Lab Exercise: Create a Component Which Takes User Input and Performs a POST Request to an API 📝🌐

## Objectives 🎯
In this task, we will create a React component that takes user input and makes a POST request to an API. This will help you understand how to interact with APIs using React.

## Prerequisites 🧐
You should have a basic understanding of JavaScript, React, and familiarity with fetch API or axios for making HTTP requests.

## Steps 🚀
1. **Set up your React environment**: Initiate a new React project using Create React App or your preferred setup.

2. **Create a new Component**: Create a new React component named 'UserInput' in your project.

3. **Initialize State**: Inside your 'UserInput' component, initialize state variables to store the user's input and any API response.

4. **Create an Input Field**: Add an HTML input field in the component's render method.

5. **Handle Input Change**: Write a method that updates the state with the user's input every time it changes. Attach this method to the input field's `onChange` event.

6. **Create a Submit Method**: Write a method that makes a POST request to the API with the user's input when a submit button is clicked.

7. **Handle API Response**: Update the state with the API response and handle any errors that may occur during the request.

8. **Display User Input and API Response**: Display the user's input and the API response on your component to verify everything is working correctly.

## Outcome 🏁
By the end of this task, you will have a functional React component that takes user input, makes a POST request to an API, and handles the response. This is a vital skill in creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
