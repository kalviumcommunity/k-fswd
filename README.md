# Lab Exercise: Write Build Script in the package.json and Build the App ðŸš€

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

In this module, you will learn how to write a build script in the package.json file to automate the build process of your full stack application. Understanding the importance of build scripts is crucial for a smooth and efficient development workflow.

## ðŸ“š Prerequisites

To complete this exercise, you should have a basic understanding of JavaScript, Node.js, and npm or yarn.

## ðŸš€ Steps

1. **Open package.json**: Locate and open the package.json file in your project directory.

2. **Add a Build Script**: Inside the "scripts" section of the package.json file, add a new key-value pair with the key "build" and the value as the build command for your app.

3. **Define the Build Command**: Specify the command that needs to be executed to build your app. This can include tasks such as transpiling, bundling, minifying, or any other necessary steps.

4. **Save the Changes**: Save the package.json file after adding the build script.

5. **Run the Build Script**: Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and execute the build script using the command `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

6. **Verify the Build**: Check the output of the build process and ensure that the necessary build artifacts are generated successfully.

## ðŸŽ‰ Outcome

By the end of this module, you will have successfully written a build script in the package.json file and automated the build process for your full stack application. This will streamline your development workflow and prepare your app for deployment. Happy building! ðŸš€
