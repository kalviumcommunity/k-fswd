# Lab Exercise: Update Schema and Render

## 🎯 Objectives

This lab teaches you to augment a MongoDB database schema with new data and reflect these changes in a React application, enhancing your full-stack development expertise.

## 🔑 Prerequisites

Proficiency in MongoDB and React is required.

## 🚀 Steps

1. **Start the Server**: First run your server through the following commands:

   ```
     cd server
     yarn
     yarn start
   ```

2. **Update your MongoDB schema**: Add a 'continent' field to your countries collection.

3. **Populate the 'continent' field**: For each country in your collection, fill in the correct continent.

4. **Find the URL where the server is running**: Please navigate to the settings icon located in the navigation sidebar. Within the settings, you will find a URL indicating where the server is currently running. The URL should end with .codedamn.app.

5. **Adjust your React component**: Ensure your component now displays the continent information alongside each country.

6. **Review your application**: Check that your application correctly displays the updated country and continent data.

## 🏁 Outcome

You'll master updating a database schema and dynamically displaying enriched data in a web application.
