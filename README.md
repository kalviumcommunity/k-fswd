# Lab Exercise: Creating a Dual-Port Express App

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and implement an Express.js application that runs on two different ports simultaneously.
- Learn to manage and configure environment variables effectively in Node.js.

## 📚 Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Node.js, Express.js, and environment variables is required.

## 🚀 Steps

1. Edit the `server.js` file.
2. Define the express apps (app1 and app2).
3. The apps sould repond with `{ "app_id": "<id of the app>" }`.

## 🏁 Outcome
By the end of this lab exercise, you will have a functional Express.js application running on two different ports simultaneously. This will enhance your understanding of server setup and environment configuration in Node.js. 🚀🎉

Remember, practice makes perfect. Keep coding! 💻👍
