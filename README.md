# Lab Exercise: Cache Management with `node-cache` in Node.js

Dive into advanced caching techniques with `node-cache` in this module, focusing on efficiently busting the cache when write operations occur to ensure data consistency and high performance.

## Objectives 🎯

- Learn to implement caching in Node.js applications using `node-cache`.
- Master cache invalidation techniques to maintain data integrity after write operations.

## Prerequisites 📚

Experience with Node.js and understanding of RESTful APIs.

## Steps 🛠️

1. **Setup Basic Caching**: Integrate `node-cache` into a sample Node.js application, caching read operations with a defined TTL (Time To Live).

2. **Perform Write Operations**: Implement a write operation (e.g., POST request to add new data) in your application.

3. **Cache Invalidation**: Upon successful write, invalidate the relevant cache entries to ensure that subsequent read operations fetch the most recent data.

4. **Implement Cache Busting Logic**: Create a strategy to selectively bust cache entries related to the modified data, rather than clearing the entire cache.

5. **Testing**: Verify that your cache busting mechanism works as intended by performing read operations before and after write operations to observe the cache being refreshed.

## Outcome 🏁

Efficiently implement and manage caching in Node.js applications, with robust cache busting on write operations to ensure data accuracy.
