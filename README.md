# Lab Exercise: Add Props to the Component and Render Two Components with Different Props 🚀

## Objectives 🎯
To understand and implement the concept of props in React, and render two distinct components utilizing different props.

## Prerequisites 🧩
A basic understanding of React and JavaScript ES6 is required.

## Steps 📝

1. **Create a New Component**: Start by creating a new React component. Let's call it `MyComponent`. Your component can be a functional or class-based component, depending on your preference.

2. **Add Props to the Component**: Next, modify `MyComponent` to accept props. If you're using a functional component, you can do this by adding an argument to the function. If you're using a class-based component, you can access props via `this.props`.

3. **Define the Props**: Now, you need to define the props that `MyComponent` will accept. For this exercise, let's say our component will accept a `title` and a `message` prop. Use these props within your component to display dynamic content.

4. **Render the Component with Different Props**: Finally, render `MyComponent` twice in your application, each time with a different set of props. For example, you might render it once with the title "Hello" and the message "World", and a second time with the title "Goodbye" and the message "Moon".

## Outcome 🏁
By following these steps, you will have a React component that accepts and uses props, and you will have rendered this component twice with different props. You will have a better understanding of how props allow for dynamic and reusable components in React. 🌟
