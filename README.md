# Lab Exercise: Dynamic UI Filtering Project

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives:

- Integrate `is_island` and `colors_in_flag` dropdowns into an existing UI.
- Display a filtered list of countries based on user selections.

## ðŸ”‘ Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## ðŸ›  Steps:

1. Begin with the provided JSON list of countries, including `name`, `country_code`, `is_island`, and `colors_in_flag` attributes.

2. Add two dropdowns to the UI:
   - `is_island` dropdown with options: Yes, No.
   - `colors_in_flag` dropdown allowing multiple selections of colors.

3. Implement JavaScript to handle dropdown selections and filter the country list accordingly.
   - Use event listeners to detect changes in dropdown values.
   - Filter the JSON list based on the selected criteria from both dropdowns.

4. Dynamically update the UI to display only the countries that match the filter criteria. Ensure no page reload is necessary for displaying the filtered results.

5. Test the functionality across different devices and browsers for compatibility and responsiveness.

## ðŸŽ‰ Outcome:

- A user-friendly interface that allows filtering countries by island status and flag colors.
