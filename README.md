# Lab Exercise: Build a Chat App

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Enable learners to create a real-time chat application using React, Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO.

- Teach the integration of frontend and backend technologies for full-stack development.

## ðŸ“š Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

## ðŸ›  Steps

1. **Clone Starter Project**: Begin by cloning the provided starter project, which includes a basic server setup and a React 
app with a simple UI (an input field and a send button).

2. **Install Socket.IO**: In both the server and client directories, install Socket.IO by running `npm install socket.io` for the server and `npm install socket.io-client` for the client.

3. **Configure Socket.IO on Server**: Set up Socket.IO in your server code to listen for connections and emit messages to connected clients.

4. **Integrate Socket.IO in React App**: Utilize Socket.IO client in the React app to establish a connection to the server and handle sending/receiving messages.

5. **Run Your Project**: Start both your server and React app. Test the real-time chat functionality by opening multiple browser tabs.

## ðŸŽ‰ Outcome

- A fully functional chat application with real-time capabilities, ready for further expansion and customization.

Learners will begin with a structured foundation, focusing solely on the integration of Socket.IO to enable real-time communication. This approach ensures a focused learning experience, emphasizing the core objective of enabling WebSocket communication in a web application.
