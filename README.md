# Lab Exercise: Create a Component to Render Data from JSON as Cards

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Learn to fetch and process data from a `data.json` file.
- Render this data as a series of visually appealing cards in a web application.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a JS framework).

## ðŸ›  Steps
1. **Set Up Your Project:** Initialize a new project or use an existing one. Ensure you have a `data.json` file with an array of objects.
2. **Read `data.json`:** Use a fetch API or similar method to read data from `data.json`.
3. **Create a Card Component:** Design a card component that can display object data (like title, image, description).
4. **Dynamic Rendering:** Use JavaScript or a framework to dynamically create and insert these cards into the DOM, based on the data in `data.json`.
5. **Styling:** Apply CSS to style the cards for an appealing and responsive layout.
6. **Testing:** Ensure the component correctly renders all data and handles errors or empty data scenarios.

## ðŸŒŸ Outcome
By the end of this task, you'll be able to dynamically render a set of cards from JSON data, showcasing your full-stack development skills. ðŸš€
