# Lab Exercise: Working with ENV Variables

## 🎯 Objectives

Learn how to create a script that depends on an Environment (ENV) variable and understand the necessity of the ENVLOADER package in managing these variables.

## 📚 Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of JavaScript and familiarity with terminal/command line usage is required.

## 🚀 Steps

1. Install the `dontenv` npm package.
2. Create an ENV variable in the `.env` file.
3. Read the ENV variable using the `dotenv` package.
4. Set the `config` variable to the `module.exports` object.
5. Use this `.env` file
   
   ```
   API_KEY=
   SERVER_SECRET= 
   IS_KALVIAN=true
   ```

## 🏁 Outcome

You will have a script that successfully retrieves an ENV variable using the ENVLOADER package, enhancing the security and flexibility of your code. 🎉🔐
